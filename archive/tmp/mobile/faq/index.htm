                        		<div class="faq-answer" lang="en-us">Our cakes are delivered fresh and are best served on the day of delivery.  If that turns out not to be the case, the cakes should be refrigerated and then later enjoyed at room temperature.</div>

                        		<div class="faq-answer" lang="en-us">Our custom cakes are just that -- custom!  So we're happy to entertain any design and taste request, for instance.  In some cases, we have practical limitations.  However, we have made cakes with special dietary restrictions in the past, and we're happy to work with you on your requirements.</div>

                        		<div class="faq-answer" lang="en-us">The height of our (non-custom) layer cakes are all the same, namely an industry standard 10 cm (4 in).  They simply differ in diameter.  You can visualize the difference <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/480337116476782652/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>

                        		<h3 lang="en-us">How should I cut my cake?</h3>
                        		<div class="faq-answer" lang="en-us">Typical wedge cuts don't really work for large cakes because you end up with giant slices of cake.  An alternate approach to cutting a larger (round) cake, which we recommend, is to cut rectangular pieces.  You can visualize the technique <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/480337116476782670/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>

                        		<h3 lang="en-us">Can I eat the flowers, figurines, etc. decorating your cakes?</h3>
                        		<div class="faq-answer" lang="en-us">We'd personally recommend that you fill your appetite on the cake itself.  While the flowers and figurines, for instance, are technically edible, we don't think you'd really enjoy the taste.  Further, some of our more complex designs require structural support.  So you wouldn't want to inadvertently ingest a piece of uncooked pasta.  In short, we recommend you stick with the cake!</div>

                        		<div class="faq-answer" lang="en-us">In some instances, it is difficult to prorate a recipe as, for instance, one cannot halve an egg.  Therefore, our minimum order size is occasionally constrained by our recipes.  In other words, this is a long way of saying that we don't typically accept orders for only a half-dozen cake pops.</div>
