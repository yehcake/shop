                    <p class="text-regular" lang="en-us">Our goal at Yeh! Cake is to help make your special event special. We believe our cakes can enhance any occasion, be it a birthday, wedding, anniversary, office party or holiday celebration. Naturally, our cakes can just be a self-reward for a personal achievement. But why not share your celebration with friends and family? After all, a Yeh! Cake cake is best enjoyed together, as a social experience that serves as a nostalgic reminder of days past and a joyful beginning to the days ahead.</p>
                    <h2 class="title-level-2" lang="en-us">Great Cakes</h2>
                    <p class="text-regular" lang="en-us">We offer a range of cakes -- from birthday cakes to bundt cakes to cupcakes -- to complement your special occasion. No matter what form, our philosophy for all our products remains the same -- great cakes start with great taste. All of our cakes are baked from scratch, using real butter, certified eggs, sugar, and flour. We use only top-quality ingredients -- pure vanilla extract, imported cocoa, and locally grown produce when available. There are no trans-fats or shortening in any of our cakes or icings. The result? Our cakes are famously moist, rich, and delicious. Of course, we also want our cakes to be equally pleasing to the eye as to the palate -- from a simple, perfectly glazed bundt cake to an elaborate, custom-decorated birthday cake.</p>
                    <h2 class="title-level-2" lang="en-us">Great Service</h2>
                    <p class="text-regular" lang="en-us">We understand that a memorable event doesn’t just happen. It requires careful planning and painstaking preparation. We support your efforts through outstanding service, which includes easy ordering, regular communication and careful delivery. We also understand that one size doesn’t necessarily fit all. Sometimes your special need calls for a custom creation and that’s okay. Whether you have a particular dietary target and/or design requirement, we are inspired by your challenge. In the end, we hope that our journey together will help win your repeat business (almost) as much as our cakes themselves.</p>
