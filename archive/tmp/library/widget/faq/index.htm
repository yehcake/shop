                        		<span class="faq-question">How should your cakes be stored?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">Our cakes are delivered fresh and are best served on the day of delivery.  If that turns out not to be the case, the cakes should be refrigerated and then later enjoyed at room temperature.</div>
                    		</li>
                    		<li>
                        		<span class="faq-question">Can you adjust your recipe for special dietary requirements?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">Our custom cakes are just that -- custom!  So we're happy to entertain any design and taste request, for instance.  In some cases, we have practical limitations.  However, we have made cakes with special dietary restrictions in the past, and we're happy to work with you on your requirements.</div>
                    		</li>
                    		<li>
                        		<span class="faq-question">How do your different layer cakes compare in size?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">The height of our (non-custom) layer cakes are all the same, namely an industry standard 10 cm (4 in).  They simply differ in diameter.  You can visualize the difference <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/480337116476782652/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>

                        		<span class="faq-question">How should I cut my cake?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">Typical wedge cuts don't really work for large cakes because you end up with giant slices of cake.  An alternate approach to cutting a larger (round) cake, which we recommend, is to cut rectangular pieces.  You can visualize the technique <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/480337116476782670/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
                    		</li>
                    		<li>
                        		<span class="faq-question">Can I eat the flowers, figurines, etc. decorating your cakes?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">We'd personally recommend that you fill your appetite on the cake itself.  While the flowers and figurines, for instance, are technically edible, we don't think you'd really enjoy the taste.  Further, some of our more complex designs require structural support.  So you wouldn't want to inadvertently ingest a piece of uncooked pasta.  In short, we recommend you stick with the cake!</div>

                        		<span class="faq-question">How far in advance do I need to place an order?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">We typically suggest at least one week notice.  Depending on the type (e.g., custom) and timing (e.g., holiday) of your order, it may be prudent to reserve well ahead of time to ensure we can schedule your order.</div>

                        		<span class="faq-question">How can I place my order?</span>

If more convenient for you, you can also <a target="_top" href="http://www.yehcake.com/?content=contact">call, text, email or fax</a> us your order.</div>

                        		<div class="faq-answer">Once we review your order, we will email you an order confirmation, thus it is important that you provide an email address on all orders.  <b>Please note your order has not been processed until you receive an affirmative confirmation from us.</b></div>

                        		<span class="faq-question">Can I order a half-dozen cake pops only?</span>
                        		<div class="faq-answer">In some instances, it is difficult to prorate a recipe as, for instance, one cannot halve an egg.  Therefore, our minimum order size is occasionally constrained by our recipes.  In other words, this is a long way of saying that we don't typically accept orders for only a half-dozen cake pops.</div>

                        		<div class="faq-answer">Presently, we operate on a catering / delivery basis so we have no storefront address. If you are looking to place an order, please <a target="_top" href="http://www.yehcake.com/?content=contact">contact us</a>.</div>

Occasionally, for practical reasons, we will deliver your order ahead of schedule -- up to a day before.  For instance, if your requested delivery time is Sunday at 8am, we will likely deliver your order on Saturday.  However, we will always notify you in these extreme cases.</div>
